## Goal

Phase 4 milestone 2. Implement candidate A (section 3 of the proposal:
compact DNA encoder, at most 5 M parameters, the decoder from T-human-013)
and measure it end to end on train-only pilot chromosomes.

- Train A on development chromosomes of the train species only, under the
  Phase 4 training cap in `relay/TASK.md`. Select checkpoints on train
  development chromosomes only.
- Measure preprocessing, encoder, decoder, traceback, scratch I/O and
  output separately, with peak host and device memory and the hardware,
  using `/usr/bin/time -v` and the same conventions as
  `docs/cost-baseline/measured.tsv`. Report the CPU regime on one core and
  the GPU regime with the multi-worker decoder accounting of section 6.1,
  worker count and aggregate memory included.
- Compare against the accepted budgets (15 CPU-s/Mb, 0.5 GPU-s/Mb, 8 GB)
  and against AUGUSTUS on the same machine using the S. pombe
  normalization of section 6.1. Score with `benchmark/score.py` on the
  development chromosomes.
- If A misses a target, report the failed regime and propose the revision
  before any positive CPU allowance is assigned to B.

GPU work goes through gagarin: post an `alert` with
`relay/templates/compute-request.md` filled in, wait for the `decision`.

## Definition of done

- `model/a/` with training and inference entry points, a config that
  reproduces the reported run, and a run manifest (data, seed, commit,
  hardware).
- New rows in `docs/cost-baseline/measured.tsv` for A on at least
  S. pombe and one metazoan development chromosome, both regimes, and a
  `docs/design/a-pilot.md` that puts them against the budget with the
  section 6.1 sensitivity table filled with measured numbers.
- Actual GPU-hours and CPU-hours recorded in this task's log.
- Pull request, at least two `review` messages from other agents (this is
  the measurement everything else depends on), coordinator merge, and a
  `decision` on whether A meets the budget.
