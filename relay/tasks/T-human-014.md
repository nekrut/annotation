## Goal

Phase 4 milestone 2. Implement candidate A (section 3 of the proposal:
compact DNA encoder, at most 5 M parameters, the decoder from T-human-013)
and measure it end to end on train-only pilot chromosomes.

- Train A on development chromosomes of the train species only, under the
  Phase 4 training cap in `relay/TASK.md`. Select checkpoints on train
  development chromosomes only.
- Measure preprocessing, encoder, decoder, traceback, scratch I/O and
  output separately, with peak host and device memory and the hardware,
  using `/usr/bin/time -v` and the same conventions as
  `docs/cost-baseline/measured.tsv`. Report the CPU regime on one core and
  the GPU regime with the multi-worker decoder accounting of section 6.1,
  worker count and aggregate memory included.
- Compare against the accepted budgets (15 CPU-s/Mb, 0.5 GPU-s/Mb, 8 GB)
  and against AUGUSTUS on the same machine using the S. pombe
  normalization of section 6.1. Score with `benchmark/score.py` on the
  development chromosomes.
- If A misses a target, report the failed regime and propose the revision
  before any positive CPU allowance is assigned to B.

GPU work goes through gagarin: post an `alert` with
`relay/templates/compute-request.md` filled in, wait for the `decision`.

## Definition of done

- `model/a/` with training and inference entry points, a config that
  reproduces the reported run, and a run manifest (data, seed, commit,
  hardware).
- New rows in `docs/cost-baseline/measured.tsv` for A on at least
  S. pombe and one metazoan development chromosome, both regimes, and a
  `docs/design/a-pilot.md` that puts them against the budget with the
  section 6.1 sensitivity table filled with measured numbers.
- Actual GPU-hours and CPU-hours recorded in this task's log.
- Pull request, at least two `review` messages from other agents (this is
  the measurement everything else depends on), coordinator merge, and a
  `decision` on whether A meets the budget.

## Log

- 2026-09-15 human: created.
- 2026-09-18 engels: claimed.
- 2026-09-18 engels: -> in_progress.
- 2026-09-18T12:23Z engels: claimed after T-human-013 merged; status in_progress.
  Audited the merged grammar and admitted-label interfaces. All ten manifest
  checksums, panel GFF checksums, summary counts and composite transcript
  identities agree (179,227 admitted / 17,451 masked); this rechecks committed
  results, not the original FASTAs. Existing grammar suite: 36 tests passed
  in 4.062 s on the available Python 3.14.4, with Python 3.11 verification
  still required. Detailed evidence, reproduction and implementation plan:
  [engels-0042](../messages/20260918T122324Z-engels-0042.md).
  Findings: the scalar grammar still needs a differentiable chain loss;
  manifests omit exon geometry and auxiliary-site coordinates, so the loader
  must rejoin checksummed raw GFF3/FASTA; trainable partial-end families and
  motif tables must match the proposal inventory. S. pombe stays held out,
  used only after freezing for the required runtime-normalization evaluation;
  fitting, checkpoint selection and development scoring use train species.
  No training or model benchmark run; training/cluster CPU-hours 0, GPU-hours
  0 (local verification CPU-hours unmetered). Next tick: implementation on
  work/T-human-014-engels, then a concrete compute request through gagarin.

- 2026-09-18T13:25Z engels: renewed lease and processed all three unread notes; no
  question required an answer. Verified an additional structured-target
  requirement: emission/phase/site masks alone count an undeclared E0 path
  for a complete gene touching the true 5' edge. Both decoders produce the
  analytically predicted excess log(7/6); explicit gold initial/terminal
  support removes it without changing the shared edge weights. An in-memory
  adapter check passed 464 synthetic cases (928 decoder configurations),
  including both strands, genetic codes 1/6, partial-end combinations,
  missing-prefix phases, acceptor conversion, and a seam at every base.
  Reproduction and limitations: [engels-0043](../messages/20260918T132457Z-engels-0043.md).
  Latest sweep: 0.1754 CPU seconds; previous equivalent sweep: 0.1793 CPU
  seconds (Python 3.14.4), total 0.3547 seconds (0.00009853 local CPU-hours).
  Other inspection/counterexample CPU time unmetered. Training/cluster
  CPU-hours 0; GPU-hours 0. No source-FASTA audit or pilot measurement.
  Implementation-file creation awaits the operator's clarification of the
  supplied AGENTS.md restrictions versus the work-branch rule; all writes
  this tick remain within owned relay metadata and new messages. Task stays
  in_progress. Next: implement the boundary-aware loader and reserved train
  chromosome split on work/T-human-014-engels once path scope is resolved;
  retain masks/crop state and prepare the executable before requesting compute.
